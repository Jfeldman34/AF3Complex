# Running CASP16 Examples

Please first complete the steps necessary to install AF3Complex, as outlined in the [installation documentation](docs/installation.md).

Afterward, please modify the run /examples/run_example.sh so that it contains the appropriate paths to the directories necessary for
running AF3Complex. 

Then, choose one of the example input jsons to be the input json for AF3Complex, which should be reflected in your run_example.sh, 
and then run run_example.sh to verify proper model installation and see the AF3Complex pipeline in action.
